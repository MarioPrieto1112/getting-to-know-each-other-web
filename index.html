<p id="para3"<p style="color:red;"<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p style="color:black;"> Hello everyone! My name is Mario Prieto. I'm from Elgin, Illinois and I currently attend Lewis University. I play baseball here for the 
        university, and have really enjoyed these last few weeks with my 
        teamates. In my free time I enjoy working out, playing poker, and hanging 
        out with my friends. I have one younger brother who is almost as big as I 
        am even though he's only 13. I have two dogs who's name are Tyson and Max. 
        My major at Lewis University is Computer Science.</p>

<p>One of my favorite hobbies that I picked up this past December is poker. I started 
    playing with a few of my high school buddies during winter break for no money. Once 
    we all began to get better and better, we decided that we should all bet while playing. 
    Since high school ended, I haven't had much of a chance to play because I've been really 
    busy with school and baseball.

    <p>A fun fact about me is I graduated high school in a M.A.G.N.E.T Stem academy. In that 
   stem academy, we never used code for any assignments.

    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
        <li><p><a href="https://www.friv.com/">friv.com</a></p></li>
        <p>Friv was one of my favorite websites growing up as a kid and will forever be a trip
            down memory lane when it comes to computers for me. 
        <li><p><a href="https://www.prepbaseballreport.com/profiles/IL/Mario-Prieto-4152987036">PBR Illinois</a></p></li>
        <p>I included this website because I think it's crazy that I can find myself on the 
            internet. This website also helped me in the recruiting process which got me here 
            at Lewis. 
        <li><p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google&rlz=1C1RXMK_enUS1016US1019&oq=google&aqs=chrome.0.0i131i355i433i512j46i131i199i433i465i512j0i131i433i512j0i433i512j0i131i433i512j69i60l3.12936j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Google.com</a></p></li>
        <p> I felt like I had to include google on this list because you can use this 
            website to look almost anything up. I find it extremely facinating you can search 
            whatever you want and it will most likely find what your looking for. 
        </ul>
